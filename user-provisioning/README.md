# User Provisioning via Microsoft Graph

This folder contains a ready-to-use PowerShell script that automates the creation of users and groups in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) using Microsoft Graph API.

The script:

- Reads user information from a CSV file
- Creates missing groups
- Creates users with assigned passwords
- Adds each user to the appropriate group
- Generates a `log.txt` and a `created_users.csv` with results

### ✳️ Assigning users to multiple groups (optional enhancement)

By default, the script reads one group per user from the `Group` column in the CSV file.  
If you want to assign users to **multiple groups**, here are two common approaches:

#### ➤ Option 1: Use a comma-separated list in the CSV

```csv

DisplayName,UserPrincipalName,MailNickname,Password,Group
Jane Doe,jane@domain.com,jane,password123,"HR,Finance,RemoteAccess"


You would need to modify the script so it:

    Splits the Group string by comma

    Iterates over each group name

    Ensures each group exists and adds the user to all of them

    ⚠️ This logic is not included in the current version of the script, but can be easily added with a foreach loop.

➤ Option 2: Use an additional column per group (not recommended for scale)

This method requires adding Group1, Group2, etc., as separate columns.
It’s less flexible and harder to maintain in larger environments.

Let me know if you'd like a future version of the script with multi-group support built-in.
