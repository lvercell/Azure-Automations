# User Provisioning via Microsoft Graph

This folder contains a ready-to-use PowerShell script that automates the creation of users and groups in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) using Microsoft Graph API.

The script:

- Reads user information from a CSV file
- Creates missing groups
- Creates users with assigned passwords
- Adds each user to the appropriate group
- Generates a `log.txt` and a `created_users.csv` with results
